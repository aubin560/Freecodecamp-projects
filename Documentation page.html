            <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within 
            a country's borders in a specific time period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it functions as a 
            comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health.

            <h1 class="header" id="def-income-ap">Income approach</h1>
            <p>The income approach states that all economic expenditures should equal the total income generated by the production of 
                all economic goods and services. According to the income approach, GDP can be computed as the sum of the total national 
                income (TNI), sales taxes (T), depreciation (D), and net foreign factor income (F). 
                Total national income is the sum of all salaries and wages, rent, interest, and profits.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Output approach">
            <h1 class="header" id="def-output-ap">Output approach</h1>
            <p>The output approach to calculate GDP sums the gross value added of various sectors, plus taxes and less subsidies on products.
               The output of the economy is measured using gross value added. Gross value added is defined as the value of all newly generated 
               goods and services less the value of all goods and services consumed in their creation; the depreciation of fixed assets is not included.
               When calculating value added, output is valued at basic prices and intermediate consumption at purchasers' prices. 
               Taxes less subsidies on products have to be added to value added to obtain GDP at market prices.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Expenditure approach">
            <h1 class="header" id="def-exp-ap">Expenditure approach</h1>
            <p>The expenditure method is a system for calculating gross domestic product (GDP) that combines consumption, investment, government spending, 
                and net exports. It is the most common way to estimate GDP.
                <span>The expenditures approach says GDP = consumption + investment + government expenditure + exports – imports.</span></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="consumption">
            <h1 class="header" id="cons">Consumption</h1>
            <p>Consumption, in economics, the use of goods and services by households. Consumption is distinct from consumption expenditure, which is the 
                purchase of goods and services for use by households. Consumption differs from consumption expenditure primarily because durable goods, 
                such as automobiles, generate an expenditure mainly in the period when they are purchased, but they generate “consumption services” 
                (for example, an automobile provides transportation services) until they are replaced or scrapped.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Investment">
            <h1 class="header" id="inv">Investment</h1>
            <p>In an economic outlook, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to generate wealth. 
                In finance, an investment is a financial asset bought with the idea that the asset will provide income further or will later be sold at 
                a higher cost price for a profit.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Government Expenditure">
            <h1 class="header" id="gvt">Government Expenditure</h1>
            <p>Government spending refers to money spent by the public sector on the acquisition of goods and provision of services such as education, 
                healthcare, social protection, and defense.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In national income accounting, when the government acquires goods and services for current use to directly satisfy the individual or 
                    collective needs and requirements of the community, it is classified as government final consumption spending.</li>
                <li>When the government acquires goods and services for future use, it is classified as government investment. This includes public 
                    consumption and public investment, and transfer payments consisting of income transfers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Import">
            <h1 class="header" id="m"> Import</h1>
            <p>An import is a good or service bought in one country that was produced in another. Imports and exports are the components of 
                international trade. If the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, the country has a negative balance of 
                trade, also known as a trade deficit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Economists and policy analysts disagree on the positive and negative impacts of imports.</li>
                <li>Free trade agreements and tariff schedules often dictate which goods and materials are less expensive to import.</li>
                <li>Imported goods or services are attractive when domestic industries cannot produce similar goods and services cheaply or efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Export">
            <h1 class="header" id="x">Export</h1>
            <p>Exports are goods and services that are produced in one country and sold to buyers in another.
                Exports are incredibly important to modern economies because they offer people and firms many more markets for their goods.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="bop">
            <h1 class="header" id="bop">Balance of Payment</h1>
            <p>The balance of payments (BOP) is a statement of all transactions made between entities in one country and the rest of 
                the world over a defined period of time, such as a quarter or a year.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="deficit bop">
            <h1 class="header" id="deficit">Negative Balance of Payment</h1>
            <p>A balance of payments deficit means the country imports more goods, services, and capital than they export. 
                It must borrow from other countries to pay for its imports.If the deficit continues long enough, the country 
                may have to sell its assets to pay its creditors.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Positive bop">
            <h1 class="header" id="surplus">Positive Balance of Payment</h1>
            <p>Balance of payments surplus occurs when a country's total exports are higher than its imports. This helps to 
                generate capital to fund its domestic productions. With a surplus in its BoP, a country can also lend funds 
                outside its borders. A surplus in BoP can help to boost the short term economic growth of a country.</p>
