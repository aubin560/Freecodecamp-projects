    <p>In 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a purely Congolese trade union of government employees that was not affiliated, 
        as were other unions, to either of the two Belgian trade-union federations (socialist and Roman Catholic). He also became 
        active in the Belgian Liberal Party in the Congo. Although conservative in many ways, the party was not linked to either of 
        the trade-union federations, which were hostile to it.</p>
    <p>In 1956 Lumumba was invited with others on a study tour of Belgium under the auspices of the minister of colonies. 
        On his return he was arrested on a charge of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later, 
        after various reductions of sentence, to 12 months’ imprisonment and a fine.</p>
    <p>When Lumumba got out of prison, he grew even more active in politics. </p>
    <p>In October 1958 he, along with other Congolese leaders, launched the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), 
        the first nationwide Congolese political party. In December he attended the first All-African People’s Conference in Accra, Ghana, 
        where he met nationalists from across the African continent and was made a member of the permanent organization set up by the conference. 
        His outlook and vocabulary, inspired by pan-African goals, now took on the tenor of militant nationalism.</p>
    <p>As nationalist fervour increased, the Belgian government announced a program intended to lead to independence for the Congo, 
        starting with local elections in December 1959. The nationalists regarded this program as a scheme to install puppets before 
        independence and announced a boycott of the elections. The Belgian authorities responded with repression. 
        On October 30 there was a clash in Stanleyville that resulted in 30 deaths. Lumumba was imprisoned on a charge of inciting to riot.</p>
    <p>The MNC decided to shift tactics, entered the elections, and won a sweeping victory in Stanleyville (90 percent of the votes). 
        In January 1960 the Belgian government convened a Round Table Conference in Brussels of all Congolese parties to discuss political 
        change, but the MNC refused to participate without Lumumba. Lumumba was thereupon released from prison and flown to Brussels. 
        The conference agreed on a date for independence, June 30, with national elections in May. Although there was a multiplicity of parties, 
        the MNC came out far ahead in the elections, and Lumumba emerged as the leading nationalist politician of the Congo. Maneuvers to prevent 
        his assumption of authority failed, and he was asked to form the first government, which he did on June 24, 1960.</p>
